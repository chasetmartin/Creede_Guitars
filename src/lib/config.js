export const philosophy = "What makes Creede Guitars unique? Inside the guitar, extraordinary effort goes into building with the goal of minimizing typical adverse humidity impacts here in Colorado, and in other not-so-dry locations. The outside of each guitar receives a unique  oil and wax finish providing a natural appearance while enhancing the clear rich resonance, sustain, and  projection of overtones sought after in a boutique instrument."
